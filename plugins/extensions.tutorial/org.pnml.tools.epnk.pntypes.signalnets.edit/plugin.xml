 This file is part of the ePNK project (Petri Net Kernel for eclipse). The ePNK
 is platform for Petri net tools based on the PNML transfer format. Its
 main idea is to provide generic Petri net types which can be easily plugged
 in and a simple generic GMF editor, that can be used for graphically editing
 nets of any plugged in type. Additional functionality can be plugged in.
 
 Note that this project is still in an experimental phase, and is also used
 as a case study for EMF/GMF based Model-based Software Engineering.
