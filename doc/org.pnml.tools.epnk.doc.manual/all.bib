	specifies safety requirements, and an arbitrary supplementary property
	that specifies liveness requirements. A refinement mapping from a
	lower-level specification $S_{1}$ to a higher-level one $S_{2}$ is
	a mapping from $S_{1}$'s state space to $S_{2}$'s state space. It
	maps steps of $S_{1}$'s state machine to steps of $S_{2}$'s state
	machine and maps behaviors allowed by $S_{1}$ to behaviors allowed
	by $S_{2}$. We show that, under reasonable assumptions about the
	specification, if $S_{1}$ implements $S_{2}$, then by adding auxiliary
	variables to $S_{1}$ we can guarantee the existence of a refinement

	a temporal property that has been specified in terms of Buchi automata.
	The method permits extraction of proof obligations for a property
	formulated as the Boolean combination of properties, each of which
	is specified by a deterministic Buchi automaton, directly from the
	individual automata. The proof obligations can be formulated as Hoare
	triples. The method is proved sound and relatively complete. A simple
	example illustrates application of the method. }},

	the debugging of distributed programs in tightly-coupled multiprocessor
	systems is defined. Techniques for the debugging of prallel programs
	require timestamping of events. The physical clocks of different
	processors are in general not suitable for time stamping events,
	because these clocks are not synchronized. Synchronization of the
	physical clocks of all processors in a multiprocessor system requires
	additional hardware mechanisms. In an alternative approach, a partial
	ordering of events can be derived using logical clocks for timestamping
	events with virtual time. The concept of virtual time has been used
	successfully to derive clock conditions in distributed systems, in
	which message-passing is the only form of interaction. In this paper,
	clock conditions are derived for tightly-coupled synchronization
	primitives in multiprocessor systems. Finally the concept is successfully
	used in the implementation of a distributed debugger in the EMPS
	multiprocessor system.}},

	for the justification of proof rules and for ascribing temporal semantics
	to properties such as layering of a program. These properties cannot
	be descibed with existing temporal logics. The semantic model of
	the logic is based on a collection of sets of interleaving sequences
	which reflect partial orders from the underlying semantics of the
	computational model. For the common partial order derived from sequentiality
	in execution of each process, the logic will distinguish between
	nondeterminism due to the parallel execution and nondeterminism due
	to local nondeterministic choices. The difference in expressive power
	is thus qualitative, and not merely due to the presence or absence
	of a particular temporal operator. In the logic, theorems are proven
	which clarify when it is possible to establish a property P for some
	of the interleaving computations, and yet conclude the truth of P
	for every interleaving.}},

  abstract = { { We present a formal proof method based on a partial order for parallel
	and distributed programs. In this view, a program's semantics is
	given by a collection of partial orders of the events which can occur
	during execution. Rather than using the partial orders directly,
	the basis of the method assumes the sets of interleaving sequences
	with global states that are consistent with each partial order (each
	such set is called an {\em interleaving set}). The proof rules allow
	concluding the correctness of certain classes of properties for all
	interleaving sequences, even though the property is only demonstrated
	directly for a subset of sequences. The subset used must include
	a representative sequence from each interleaving set, and the proof
	rules guarantee that this is the case when they may be applied. The
	method employs proof lattices, and is expressed using the temporal
	logic ISTL$^{*}$. By choosing a subset with appropriate sequences,
	simpler intermediate assertions can be used than in previous formal
	approaches.}},

	reduce their grain of atomicity, or to allow for easy implementation

	Mazurkiewicz's traces have been used; the model gives rise to a partial

	$P$ will remain true until $S$ terminates, and $Q$ will be true if

  abstract = { { Petri nets are widely used to model concurrent systems. However,
	their composition and abstraction mechanisms are inadequate: we solve
	this problem in a satisfactory way. We start by remarking that place/transition
	Petri nets can be viewed as ordinary, directed graphs equipped with
	two algebraic operations corresponding to parallel and sequential
	composition of transitions. A distributive law between the two operations
	captures a basic fact about concurrency. New morphisms are defined,
	mapping single, atomic transitions into whole computations, thus
	relating system descriptions at different levels of abstraction.
	Categories equipped with products and coproducts (corresponding to
	parallel and nondeterministic composition) are introduced for Petri
	nets with and without initial markings. Petri net duality is expressed
	as a duality functor, and several new invariants are introduced.
	A tensor product is defined on nets, and their category is proved
	to be symmetric monoidal closed. This is generalised to a large class
	of algebraic theories on graphs. These results provide a formal basis
	for expressing the semantics of concurrent languages in terms of
	Petri nets. They also provide a new understanding of concurrency
	in terms of algebraic structures over graphs and categories that
	should apply to other models besides Petri nets and thus contribute
	to the conceptual unification of concurrency.}}

	logic, inter alia. In this paper we extract from these three approaches
	a single hybrid approach having a rich language that mixes algebra
	and logic and having a natural class of models of concurrent processes.
	The heart of the approach is a notion of partial string derived from
	the view of a string as a linearly ordered multiset by relaxing the
	linearity constraint, thereby permitting partially ordered multisets
	or {\em pomsets}. Just as sets of strings form languages, so do sets
	of pomsets form processes. We introduce a number of operations useful
	for specifying concurrent processes and demonstrate their utility
	on some basic exapmles. Although none of the operations is particularly
	oriented to nets it is nevertheless possible to use them to express
	processes constructed as a net of subprocesses, and more generally
	as a system consisting of componenets. The general benefits of the
	approach are that it is conceptually straightforward, involves fewer
	artificial constructs than many competing models of concurrency,
	yet is applicable to a considerably wider range of types of systems,
	including systems with buses and ethernets, analog systems, and real-time
	systems. }},

	a program, then $x$ can be replaced by $y$ in any property of the
	program'', is problematic for several reasons. In this paper, dual
	predicate transformers {\bf sst} and {\bf wst} are introduced that
	allow the strongest invariant of a program to be expressed, and these
	are used to give a new definition for the temporal operators {\it
	unless} and {\it ensures}. With the new definitions, the substitution
	axiom is no longer needed, and can be replaced by a derived rule
	of inference which is formally justified in the logic. One important
	advantage is that the effect of the initial conditions on the properties
	of a program are formally captured in a convenient way, and one can
	forget about substitution in formal treatments of the UNITY proof
	system while still having it available when desirable to use during
	the derivation of programs. Composibility and completeness of the
	modified logic are also discussed.}}

	proving the properties of transition systems is presented. It is
	assumed that any property of a system can be defined by giving a
	set of `target' states and a type of reachability. Ten different
	types of reachability are proposed; by appropriately choosing the
	set of target states, a family of ten potentially different properties
	is generated. The main conclusion is that the reachability types
	and therefore the system properties, can be characterized by simple
	relations involving the set of the possible initial states and fixed
	points of certain continuous predicate transformers depending on
	the set of target states. As a consequence, in order to prove a given
	property it is sufficient to compute iteratively greatest or least
	fixed points of continuous predicate transformers. fixed points of
	continuous predicate transformers. Some examples are presented which
	show how the results can be applied to prove the properties of concurrent
	systems represented by non-deterministic models.}}
